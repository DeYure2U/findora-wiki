# Introduction


The test network consists of an instance of the Findora ledger, operated by a fixed set of validators. The validators will run a permissioned BFT protocol for network consensus. We are also working on a public testnet accessible to the Findora community.

The Findora System has three components visible to Findora Testnet users and developers: a wallet application example, a JavaScript library interface, and a raw web interface.
